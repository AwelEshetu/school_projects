Input and output.

functions: stdin,stdout,stderr.
predefined c functions to read and write single characters.
int getchar()....for reading single character.
int putchar()....for writing a single character.

streams in c can be opened using fopen()
// FILE *fopen(const char*filename, const char*mode);

filename: string containing the name of the file to be opened in the format recongrnised by 
          the environment.
mode: indicates how the file is to be used....
r  - open for reading
w  - open for writing (file need not exist)
a  - open for appending (file need not exist)
r+ - open for reading and writing, start at beginning
w+ - open for reading and writing (overwrite file)
a+ - open for reading and writing (append if file exists)


eg. to open a file..
. 
  FILE *fp;
fp=fopen("c:\\test.txt", "r");// will open the file test.txt in text mode.
// if need to open in binary mode ,include b with r.....that is "rb".

to close th fopen function we can use the following.

int fclose(FILE *a_file); // function to close fopen function.

eg.fclose(*fp);


to write or on the file. we can use fprintf and to read from a file we can use fscanf which are pretty 
similar to printf and scanf expecpt that file pointer is passed as the the frist argument.
eg.

FILE *fp;
fp=fopen("c:\\test.txt", "w");
fprintf(fp, "Testing...\n");


to read single character at a time ....we should use a function as below.

int fgetc(FILE *fp);.....// fgetc take a file pointer and returns int which actually 
means that when it reads a normal character in the file,it return a value suitable for storing
in an unsigned char(basically a number in the range 0 to 255).
