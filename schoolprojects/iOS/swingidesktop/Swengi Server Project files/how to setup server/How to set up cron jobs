cron jobs:
----------------
cron is a time keeper on the linux system. you need to edit the crontab
file and add an entry for anything to happen. Its best to use the root 
account for setting these jobs in the event the script needs root privileges.
to set an entry log into the server by opening terminal. Connect to your server thorough terminal using ssh.

from there type sudo su. this puts you as a root user. now type
crontab -e
it should ask which editor you want to use. select nano if it asks. 
if not it may already use nano
scroll to the bottom of the file with the down arrow key and add these four lines.

* * * * * php < your installation path >/php_files/pushUpdate.php >/dev/null 2>&1
*/5 * * * * php  < your installation path >/php_files/deleteUpdates.php >/dev/null 2>&1
* * * * * php < your installation path >/php_files/multiplepushcron.php >/dev/null 2>&1
0 0 1 * * php < your installation path >/php_files/old_event.php >/dev/null 2>&1

< your installation path > in above commands means the path to the suupercali installation in your server.

the stars at the beginning represent minutes hours days  months and year. 
For example, * * * * * sets the cron job to go every minute of every day of every month. 
please look up cron in google for more specific detail of how to set these. 
after the stars is the command php which is needed to run php scripts.
the next thing is the full path to the php file we want to run:

/var/www/test/pushUpdate.php

and lastly there is a command so corn will not send an email every time it
runs the job:

>/dev/null 2>&1

once you have your job set press ctrl & o (thats the letter o). It will ask where to save the file. Just hit enter. this will 
save the file. then press ctrl & x to exit. your done. 
You have just added cron job entries for four PHP scripts
